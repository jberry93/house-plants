    "description": "Coyote Mint, Monardella villosa, is a two-foot-high perennial with gray-green leaves and light purple clusters of flowers in summer. This Monardella is native to the California coast ranges. This coyote mint likes part shade to sun and is drought tolerant but takes garden water if given perfect drainage. Smells like a minty toothpaste and was used by Spanish as cure for sore throats. Butterflies use as a nectar source. Make sure you put it in the sun if you want butterflies. All the monardellas seem to be fairly deer proof, (notice the hedging). If this mint is happy it will form a small mat of gray covered with flowers and butterflies.  -Las Pilitas Nursery ",
