    "description": "Encelia californica is a fast growing, woody shrub with bright green foliage and yellow daisy-type flowers that bloom from spring through summer. It can be used effectively in just about any landscape with regular or occasional  pruning to maintain form.  In inland situations, it requires more regular water during summer to look better.  It grows to 3'-5' tall and wide. This plant attracts bees and butterflies in abundance. It does best in coastal areas from which it is native. It is a short lived plant but makes up for its shorter life with more color than most plants. ",
