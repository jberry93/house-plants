In late spring and summer 'Bubba'&trade; produces masses of large, dark burgundy, fragrant flowers. This is a winter deciduous tree that flushes out in the spring with glossy, dark green leaves. Like other desert willows 'Bubba'&trade; is a great choice for full sun, low maintenance, water efficient landscapes. Although it is not seedless, it produces fewer pods than most selections. ",
