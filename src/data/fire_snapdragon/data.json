    "description": "Island Snapdragon is an evergreen perennial that grows from 2'-3' high and 3'-5' across with red spring and summer flowers. In coastal areas, this plant acts as a ground cover. It can spill over a retaining wall or a hillside. Looks great in containers. This plant needs partial shade in hot inland areas. It tolerates clay, loam, rocky or sandy soil, thus making it a versatile plant in many areas. It is a California native that is drought tolerant but will look better with additional summer water. It attracts hummingbirds in a big way.. Prune in winter so it is not so woody. Fast growing. This selection boasts the bright red flower of its parent Galvezia speciosa but with a bushier, more compact habit. ",
