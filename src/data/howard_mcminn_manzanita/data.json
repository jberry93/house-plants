    "description": "This shrub is highly appreciated for its decorative characteristics, which include a dense show of small, pale pink urn-shaped flowers in winter and spring. One of its main often overlooked attractions of this plant is the mahogany-red to brown bark (which peels beautifully) that can be revealed with some internal pruning once the plant is mature . It's small, red fruit resembles the tike apple, appearing at the end of winter just as Spring is coming on. Evergreen, shiny leaves are very neat and tidy. It can reach 8' tall and 10 wide. It can be pruned to desired size. This shrub attracts butterflies and hummingbirds. It does best in full sun in coastal areas and afternoon shade in warm, inland areas with well draining soil. Established plants need little or no water in coastal areas and occasional watering in warmer areas. ",
