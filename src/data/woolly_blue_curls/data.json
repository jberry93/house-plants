    "description": "Woolly Blue Curls is an evergreen shrub that reaches 3'-5' high. It has an open branching habit and has long stalks of brilliant purple woolly flowers in the spring and summer. This California native, is drought tolerant, and attracts hummingbirds. It puts on a dramatic display of purple stealing the show when in bloom. This is a highly prized compact, medium sized shrub that produces breath-taking deep purple to blue flowers. This shrub prefers minimal watering after establishment, well drained soil and plenty of sun. It naturally occurs below 2000' ft. Woolly Blue Curls grows fast, reaching about 4 ft in height and the same in width. The leaves are needle like, thick skinned points that are a light to dark green. The spring and summer flowers are loved by bees, hummingbirds, butterflies, and a favorite of Native gardeners. This very hardy, drought tolerant native was extremely important to indigenous Americans, who used almost all parts of the plant for medicinal uses, especially for stomach ailments. Indeed, it became so important that it was used as a currency at times. Tea made from sprigs of Woolly Blue Curls is also extremely tasty, with a soothing, calming effect. ",
