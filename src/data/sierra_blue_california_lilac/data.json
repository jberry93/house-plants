    "description": "This Ceanothus is a fast-growing shrub or small tree 12' high and wide. The springtime flowers are a stunning deep blue in large 6\" clusters. This selection can be pruned into a lovely small tree or allowed to develop into a broad shrub for a fast screen. Provide well drained soil. Tends toward legginess - prune after flowering for a denser plant. ",
