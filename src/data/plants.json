In coastal areas, this plant acts as a ground cover. It can spill over a retaining wall or a hillside. Looks great in containers. This plant needs partial shade in hot inland areas. It tolerates clay, loam, rocky or sandy soil, thus making it a versatile plant in many areas. It is a California native that is drought tolerant but will look better with additional summer water. It attracts hummingbirds in a big way.. Prune in winter so it is not so woody. Fast growing. This selection boasts the bright red flower of its parent Galvezia speciosa but with a bushier, more compact habit. ",

It has an open branching habit and has long stalks of brilliant purple woolly flowers in the spring and summer. This California native, is drought tolerant, and attracts hummingbirds. It puts on a dramatic display of purple stealing the show when in bloom. This is a highly prized compact, medium sized shrub that produces breath-taking deep purple to blue flowers. This shrub prefers minimal watering after establishment, well drained soil and plenty of sun. It naturally occurs below 2000' ft. Woolly Blue Curls grows fast, reaching about 4 ft in height and the same in width. The leaves are needle like, thick skinned points that are a light to dark green. The spring and summer flowers are loved by bees, hummingbirds, butterflies, and a favorite of Native gardeners. This very hardy, drought tolerant native was extremely important to indigenous Americans, who used almost all parts of the plant for medicinal uses, especially for stomach ailments. Indeed, it became so important that it was used as a currency at times. Tea made from sprigs of Woolly Blue Curls is also extremely tasty, with a soothing, calming effect. ",

It grows to 3'-5' tall and wide. This plant attracts bees and butterflies in abundance. It does best in coastal areas from which it is native.

It's small, red fruit resembles the tike apple, appearing at the end of winter just as Spring is coming on. Evergreen, shiny leaves are very neat and tidy. It can reach 8' tall and 10 wide. It can be pruned to desired size. This shrub attracts butterflies and hummingbirds. It does best in full sun in coastal areas and afternoon shade in warm, inland areas with well draining soil.
