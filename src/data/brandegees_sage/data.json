    "description": "This rare Salvia grows 3'-4' tall and 4' wide. Leaves are lance shaped, aromatic, dark green above and white and hairy below. Pale blue clusters of flowers cover the plant in spring, attracting hummingbirds and butterflies. This plant will bloom more in full sun but tolerates part sun. It is drought tolerant once it's established and likes well draining soil. It is deer resistant. It tolerates coastal conditions and frost. ",
